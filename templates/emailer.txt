by Friday July 11, 2014.

It is important that we receive your report by the due date as the
information is required in order to fulfill government and university
annual reporting deadlines. Particularly important is information on
publications, grants and collaborations related to your use of the
HPC facility. With this in mind the report form has been designed so
that it should not take up too much of your time.

Please contact Jarrod Hurley <jhurley@swin.edu.au> if you have any
questions about the reporting process.

Thanks very much.

All the best,
The Swinburne HPC Team
