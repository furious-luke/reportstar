{% if account %}g2 (gSTAR/swinSTAR) annual project report for {{ account }}
Dear {% if title %}{{ title }}{% endif %} {{ givenname }} {{ surname }},

Please complete the g2 annual project reporting questionnaire at:

  {{ site }}{{ random }}

by Friday July 10, 2015.

It is important that we receive your report by the due date as the
information is required in order to fulfill government and university
annual reporting deadlines. Particularly important is information on
publications, grants and collaborations related to your use of the
HPC facility. With this in mind the report form has been designed so
that it should not take up too much of your time.

Please also make an effort to keep your Project Description informative
and up-to-date, also noting the requirement to provide an associated image.
This information allows us to document and publicise projects, which is
necessary to satisfy grant funding bodies.

We would also like to remind project leaders about the requirement to
provide the facility acknowledgement in all associated publications,
as described in our usage policies:

   http://www.supercomputing.swin.edu.au/policies/

Failure to adhere to the usage policies or to fulfill requests for project
information may lead to facility access becoming restricted, although we are
keen to avoid such a situation arising.

Contact Jarrod Hurley <jhurley@swin.edu.au> if you have any
questions about the reporting process.

Thanks very much.

All the best,
The Swinburne HPC Team

{% else %}g2 (gSTAR/swinSTAR) Annual User Feedback Opportunity - Please help us by completing the linked short survey by Friday July 10th
Dear g2 account holder,

To help us to continue to refine and improve the HPC services that we offer
we are seeking feedback on your experience in using the g2 facility at Swinburne
(comprising the gSTAR and swinSTAR compute nodes). Please take the time
to complete the short survey form (<10 mins) prepared for you at:

  {{ site }}{{ random }}

noting that we are focussed on usage over the past 12 months.
Areas covered include hardware, software, support and training.

At the end of the survey you have the option of providing your g2 username,
thus you may choose to be anonymous or not. Please bear in mind that by
providing your username it will allow us to follow-up on any specific queries you
may have and thus directly improve your usage experience (which is the goal).

Completed responses by Friday July 10th will be much appreciated.

If you have not used g2 in the past 12 months or have only had your account for
a short time (a few months or less) please ignore this request.

Cheers,
Jarrod Hurley (on behalf of the g2 support team)
