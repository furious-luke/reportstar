Please complete the g2 annual project reporting questionnaire at:

  {{ site }}{{ random }}

by Friday July 10, 2015.

It is important that we receive your report by the due date as the
information is required in order to fulfill government and university
annual reporting deadlines. Particularly important is information on
publications, grants and collaborations related to your use of the
HPC facility. With this in mind the report form has been designed so
that it should not take up too much of your time.

Please also make an effort to keep your Project Description informative
and up-to-date, also noting the requirement to provide an associated image.
This information allows us to document and publicise projects, which is
necessary to satisfy grant funding bodies.

We would also like to remind project leaders about the requirement to
provide the facility acknowledgement in all associated publications,
as described in our usage policies:

   http://www.supercomputing.swin.edu.au/policies/

Failure to adhere to the usage policies or to fulfill requests for project
information may lead to facility access becoming restricted, although we are
keen to avoid such a situation arising.

Contact Jarrod Hurley <jhurley@swin.edu.au> if you have any
questions about the reporting process.

Thanks very much.

All the best,
The Swinburne HPC Team
